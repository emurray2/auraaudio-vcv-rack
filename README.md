# auraaudio-vcv-rack
My first VCV Rack Plugin

Note: I do not have a cross-compiler or virtual machine, so I do not know how this will compile on other platforms besides Mac OS Catalina.

Update: I was able to compile on Windows 10 64 bit! I will update the Makefile and code shortly! I discovered that I needed to link the necessary OpenGL library flags inside the Makefile. It's strange that I didn't need to do that on Mac but oh well. I am learning many great things as a novice developer.
